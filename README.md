# 🔁 Customer Churn Prediction System

This repository contains a machine learning project built as part of an internship assignment. The goal is to develop a **Churn Prediction System** that identifies which customers are likely to stop using a service. This kind of model is crucial in industries like **telecom, SaaS, and banking**, where retaining customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this hands-on project, we use **real-world customer data** to build, train, and evaluate classification models for predicting churn. We also extract business insights and present results using a **Power BI dashboard** or **visual reports** that can guide data-driven decisions.

---

## ✅ What You’ll Do

- Explore and clean customer datasets (e.g., telecom, banking)
- Engineer relevant features like contract type, tenure, payment method, etc.
- Train & evaluate classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Compute churn probabilities for individual customers
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix
- Visualize key churn drivers with Power BI or Matplotlib
- Present findings in a business-friendly dashboard or report

---

## 🎯 Skills You’ll Gain

- 🧠 Classification & predictive modeling
- 🧹 Data wrangling and feature engineering
- 📊 Evaluation: confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, precision-recall
- 📈 Business storytelling with dashboards
- 📉 Risk segmentation & churn probability analysis
